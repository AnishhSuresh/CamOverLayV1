# ML Model Integration Guide

## Current Implementation Status ✅

Your app now has:
- ✅ Live camera feed with AVCaptureSession
- ✅ Gallery image picker
- ✅ ML model wrapper with placeholder predictions
- ✅ Real-time camera frame processing
- ✅ UI layout with camera under selected image
- ✅ Camera permissions (added to project build settings)

## Next Steps: Adding a Real ML Model

### Option 1: Use Apple's Built-in Vision Framework Models

The easiest way to get started is with Apple's pre-trained models:

1. **Add Vision Framework** (already imported in MLModelWrapper.swift)
2. **Replace the placeholder code** in `MLModelWrapper.swift`:

```swift
// Uncomment and modify the setupVisionModel() method:
private func setupVisionModel() {
    do {
        // For image classification
        let model = try VNCoreMLModel(for: MobileNetV2().model)
        visionModel = model
    } catch {
        print("Error setting up ML model: \(error)")
    }
}

// Uncomment the processImageWithCoreML method and use it instead of the mock
```

### Option 2: Add Your Own Core ML Model

1. **Download a Core ML model** (.mlmodel file):
   - From Apple's Core ML Models: https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/
   - Convert from other formats using coremltools
   - Train your own model

2. **Add the model to your Xcode project**:
   - Drag the .mlmodel file into your Xcode project
   - Make sure "Add to target" is checked for your app

3. **Update MLModelWrapper.swift**:
   ```swift
   private func setupVisionModel() {
       do {
           // Replace "YourModel" with your actual model class name
           let model = try VNCoreMLModel(for: YourModel().model)
           visionModel = model
       } catch {
           print("Error setting up ML model: \(error)")
       }
   }
   ```

### Option 3: Use OpenCV for Computer Vision

Since you already have OpenCV integrated:

1. **Add OpenCV processing** in `CameraCoordinator.captureOutput`:
   ```swift
   func captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
       guard let pixelBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(sampleBuffer) else { return }
       
       // Convert to OpenCV Mat
       let ciImage = CIImage(cvPixelBuffer: pixelBuffer)
       let context = CIContext()
       
       if let cgImage = context.createCGImage(ciImage, from: ciImage.extent) {
           // Process with OpenCV
           let openCVMat = OpenCVWrapper.processImage(cgImage)
           
           // Convert back to UIImage and update UI
           DispatchQueue.main.async {
               self.parent.capturedImage = openCVMat
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add OpenCV processing methods** to `OpenCVWrapper.mm`:
   ```cpp
   + (UIImage *)processImage:(CGImageRef)image {
       // Your OpenCV processing code here
       // Return processed UIImage
   }
   ```

## Testing Your Implementation

1. **Build and run** the app on a physical device (camera doesn't work in simulator)
2. **Grant camera permissions** when prompted
3. **Tap "Start Camera"** to begin live feed
4. **Check ML predictions** in the blue box above the camera
5. **Use "Capture"** button to save current frame as selected image

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure you're testing on a physical device
- Check that camera permissions are granted
- Verify Info.plist has NSCameraUsageDescription

### ML Model Not Loading
- Check that the .mlmodel file is added to the target
- Verify the model class name matches your .mlmodel file
- Check Xcode console for error messages

### Performance Issues
- Reduce camera resolution in AVCaptureSession settings
- Process every nth frame instead of every frame
- Use background queues for ML processing

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Start with Apple's MobileNetV2** for image classification
2. **Add object detection** using YOLOv3 or similar
3. **Implement custom OpenCV filters** for real-time processing
4. **Add overlay functionality** to draw on the camera feed
